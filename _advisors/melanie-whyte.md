I am a parent to the incredibly brave Ieisha who lives with multiple disabilities.  My journey with Ieisha has been a path of growth, learning and empowerment.  As I've navigated the challenges of caregiving, I've discovered strengths I didn't know I had, including persistence,resilience and determination.  Ieisha has taught me how to embrace change and to keep learning. I'm very passionate about sharing my experiences to help others to do the same.
