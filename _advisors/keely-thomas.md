Keely is a mother to a 16 year old young man with cerebral palsy and epilepsy. When he was first diagnosed there was limited, if any, advice or support for our journey ahead. I worked for 6 years as a SEND (Special Educational Needs and Disability) teaching assistant and have learned a lot along the way. Being involved with the Encompass study I will hopefully be able to help those in the early stages of diagnosis to ease the loneliness and struggles through my lived experience.
