My professional journey is deeply rooted in my lived experience, which serves as the foundation of my role as a qualified Parent Facilitator. By sharing my personal insights, I aim to empower other parents and carers facing similar challenges, helping them navigate the available services and opportunities with confidence.

<br />

Recently, I established the SEND (Special Educational Needs and Disability) Community group, a parent-led initiative designed to provide support, guidance, and a sense of belonging to families of children with special educational needs and disabilities. In addition, I organise jewellery workshops that are open to all, with some specifically tailored to SEN parents, fostering creativity and connection within the community. I have also just started my own podcast. 

<br />

I learnt about Person-Centred Active Support (PCAS) when I was invited to attend a workshop. PCAS means for me and my family that my child with a disability can do things that are part of everyday life. I've been co-trained to deliver PCAS, which was a new experience that I really enjoyed, I felt connected to other parents because I am coming from a parent's point of view.
