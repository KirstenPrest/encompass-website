The "Encompass" programme aims to support children and young people with complex neurodisability, using cerebral palsy (CP) as an exemplar condition. CP is the most common childhood physical disability globally. Children with CP and their families have multiple, complex healthcare needs. Research shows that parents/carers of children with CP require a large amount of support and information, particularly just after the diagnosis, however this is often lacking. They also benefit from forming support networks with other caregivers.

The Ubuntu model of interventions was seen as a potential solution, as parents/carers gain knowledge about caring for their child, while forming support networks.

“Ubuntu (previously: Getting to know Cerebral Palsy)” is a community-based participatory caregiver programme that has been developed and successfully tested in resource limited settings such as Uganda, Ghana and Bangladesh, and has been implemented in low and low- and middle-income countries globally. The group programme is comprehensive in that it aims to promote inclusion and participation for the child with CP in the community, to maximise the child’s health and development, to empower caregivers through information sharing and peer support, to address stigma, and to promote the human rights of children with disabilities. The groups are co-facilitated by a health professional and an 'expert parent' with lived experience.

Various forms of the "Ubuntu" programme have been tested in many low- and middle- income countries, where it was found to improve parents’ and children’s quality of life. 

> It has not yet been adapted and tested in a high-income country, such as the UK.
